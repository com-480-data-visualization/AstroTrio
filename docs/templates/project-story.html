            <h4>üåç Earth ‚Äî Let the exploration start !</h4>
            <p>
                Our journey through space begins right here on Earth ‚Äî the launchpad of humanity‚Äôs cosmic ambitions.
                With the <strong>Launch Map</strong>, you can explore over half a century of rocket launches, tracking 
                how different nations and companies have contributed to the story of space exploration. 
                Filter by year, success, or agency to see how our global footprint in space has evolved over time, how the Space Race between USSR and USA started. 
                It's a powerful way to connect geopolitics, innovation, and discovery ‚Äî all through the lens of a world map.

            <h4>ü™ê Solar System ‚Äî Looking at our celestial neighbors</h4>
            <p>
                Next, we zoom out to the <strong>Solar System</strong>, where the planets orbit the Sun in a 
                dynamic visualization designed for exploration and learning. 
                Here, you can compare key characteristics of the 8 planets ‚Äî mass, temperature, gravity, size ‚Äî 
                through interactive charts. It‚Äôs an intuitive way to understand just how diverse our planetary neighborhood is, 
                and to reflect on the uniqueness of Earth in the solar system.

            <h4>üåå Milky Way ‚Äî Taking a look at our galaxy </h4>
            <p>
                Finally, we take a bold step outward, far beyond our own system, into the <strong>Milky Way</strong>. 
                This visualization animates the discovery of <em>exoplanets</em> over time, showing how astronomers have 
                gradually mapped the invisible. With each data point, we uncover a planet orbiting a distant star, 
                hinting at the possibility of other Earths. Explore the different methods of detection, temperatures, and 
                orbital distances to understand what we know ‚Äî and how much more there is to discover.

            <p style="color: #aaabac;">
                From Earth to the edges of our galaxy, these visualizations offer a journey through space at three scales ‚Äî inviting you to explore how our understanding of the universe has grown, one discovery at a time.
