## Milestone 1 (21st March, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

This is a preliminary milestone to let you set up goals for your final project and assess the feasibility of your ideas.
Please, fill the following sections about your project.

### Dataset

For our data visualization project, we have selected two datasets related to space missions. Each dataset contains different informations and variables that we will use for different and complementary visualizations.  

1. **Real-world dataset (```space_missions_1957_2022.csv```):** This dataset includes all space missions from 1957 to August 2022. It contains details such as the launch location, date, result, the company responsible for the mission, and the name, price, and status of the rocket used. This dataset allows us to visualize historical and geographical trends in space exploration, evolution of launch frequencies, and the role of different space agencies and companies over time. The dataset is already quite clean and structured, and there is not much preprocessing needed, mostly related to handling missing values and looking at the categorical variables. Further details are covered in the EDA.

2. **Synthetic dataset (```space_missions_dataset.csv```):** This dataset provides structured, simulated data on various aspects of space exploration, including mission details, spacecraft specifications, launch dates, mission objectives, and success probabilities. While not based on real missions, this dataset can be interesting to be used for exploratory visualizations, completing the historical data. This dataset is also well structured and requires no significant preprocessing.

Since the two datasets do not have the same structure and columns, we will not merge them but use them both for distinct visualizations that complement each other. Through this approach, we aim to create a set of insightful visualizations that together provide a comprehensive view of space missions, from historical data to exploratory scenarios.  

### Problematic

> Frame the general topic of your visualization and the main axis that you want to develop.
> - What am I trying to show with my visualization?
> - Think of an overview for the project, your motivation, and the target audience.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

> Pre-processing of the data set you chose
> - Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data

### Related work

#### What others have already done with the data?  
There are several projects that have explored and analyzed space mission datasets:  
- **[EDA: Discovering Space](https://www.kaggle.com/code/timurkhabirovich/eda-discovering-space)**  
  - Feature correlations, K-means clustering, and scatter plots of mission cost vs. scientific yield.  
  - Mission duration distributions and forecasting of mission success.  

- **[Space Missions Cost Visualization](https://www.kaggle.com/code/stpeteishii/space-mission-cost-visualize-importance)**  
  - Scatter plots analyzing mission costs and trends.  

- **[Space Missions EDA](https://www.kaggle.com/code/hainescity/space-missions-eda)**  
  - Feature correlations and scatter plots (e.g., distance vs. duration, success vs. cost).  

- **[Space Missions Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/code/timothyddumba/space-missions)**  
  - Exploratory analysis and mission success predictions using machine learning.

These works provide a foundation while leaving room for originality in our approach.  

#### Sources of inspiration  

We found a project from two years ago and a website that did some visualization related to space:

- **[GitHub project](https://github.com/com-480-data-visualization/project-2023-astro-vizards)** from this course, focused on satellite visualizations.

- **[Planetary Society - Space Missions](https://www.planetary.org/space-missions)**: 3D visualizations of planets, informations about past missions

#### Why is our approach original?  
- **Dual dataset approach**: We create distinct yet complementary visualizations: one focused on historical data and one on synthetic future scenarios.  
- **Interactive elements**: A dynamic archive of past launches and an engaging representation of future missions.  
- **Educational purpose**: Our goal is to make space exploration more accessible to the public and people interested in space in general
